# Create-First-GUI-Application-using-Python-Tkinter
Tkinter a Python Package for creating GUI applications. Python has a lot of GUI frameworks, but Tkinter is the only framework that’s built into the Python standard library. Tkinter has several strengths; it’s cross-platform, so the same code works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Tkinter is lightweight and relatively painless to use compared to other frameworks. This makes it a compelling choice for building GUI applications in Python, especially for applications where a modern shine is unnecessary, and the top priority is to build something that’s functional and cross-platform quickly.  

To understand Tkinter better, we will create a simple GUI. 

Getting Started
1. Import tkinter package and all of its modules.
2. Create a root window. Give the root window a title(using title()) and dimension(using geometry()).  All other widgets will be inside the root window. 
3. Use mainloop() to call the endless loop of the window. If you forget to call this nothing will appear to the user. The window will wait for any user interaction till we close it.
